# Screen-Helper
Based on RoboMate.

This project is something like virtual assistant. It's concept more, but i'll be glad if you will help to develop this project.
I think, this project can become something like base soft for the PC with the OS on the board only. (someone, correct me, if I gave grammar mistakes :D)

Functions it has - rendering the character on the screen, you can write some commands in the input box, click on the character, to toggle input box and drag the character.

Commands:
- привет - say hello
- погода - weather (in Nur-Sultan only)
- браузер - after you write this, it will ask you to write a search query or address.

I have a lot of ideas, but I can't bring them to life alone.

I want to make an application that will help people who do not know how to work with a PC to work with it without inconvenience. And for everyone else to make it more convenient to use the computer.

I hope to make a big open-source project. :)
